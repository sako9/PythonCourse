    "Welcome and greetings everyone! This is a course with the purpose of teaching you have to develop in python. Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language that is relatively easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. The goal of this course is to not only teach you have to develop in python but to also teach you have to think like a developer and apply what you learn here to your own projects.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already go ahead and install python 3 onto your computer(go ahead and install python 3 even if you already have python 2). You can download python from the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\"> python website</a>. Don't forget to select the option that adds python to your path. A link to detailed instruction can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7xbmVFrcwSBtOlUOslDqYcBTwCY3BdueKDvR0nI1MU/edit?usp=sharing\"> here </a>.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What does do? pip is a package managment system that allows us to install and manage software packages written in python. I'll go into more detail about all the possible modules we can install with pip later. For now we're using pip to install jupyter and all of its dependencies. I will be using jupyter to write up all the lessons and share the jupyter notebooks with you. This allows you to have a copy of everything we've gone over and run the code examples.\n",

To start the interactive shell all you have to do is open up a console(terminal) and use the command:\n",

    "Let's try out the interactive shell by doing some Math! In your console/terminal(or in the space below) type in ```2 + 2```. You should get an output of 4. Congrats you just wrote your first python expression! An expression is the most basic kind of programming instruction in a programming language. Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value. That means you can use expressions anywhere in Python code that you could also use a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, 2 + 2 is evaluated down to a single value, 4. A single value with no operators is also considered an expression, though it evaluates only to itself."

Thing to note, thought the value 42 is an int the value 42.0 is a float. If you ever have trouble distinguishing in between the two just rememeber that anything number with a decimal point is a float and any number without one is an int.\n",

Strs start and end with a quote('') or double quote(\"\") with characters in between. \"Hello world\" is an example of a string. Before we added two numbers(ints) together with the '+' operator but what happens when we use '+' on two strings?"
