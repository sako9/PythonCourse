    "Welcome back to another Python Lesson! Last week we went over logical operators, if/elif/else statements and loops; If you have been following along with the excercises you also have completed the first project. Today we are going to go over a few more data types, specifically List, tuples, and dicts.Most of the stuff i'm covering today came from [here](http://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Collections.html) give it a read if you're curious.\n",

    "## Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection is  an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data. The datatypes that we are going over today are all examples of collections and are very useful when we need to do work on multiple elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The first collection type we are going to go over are Lists. A List is a type of sequence – we can use it to store multiple values, and access them sequentially, by their position, or index, in the list. We define a list literal by putting a comma-separated list of values inside square brackets ([ and ]):"

In python, the numbering of indexes start at zero meaning that the index of the first element of a list is zero, the index of the second element is 1 and so on."

The keys of a dictionary can be any immutable type, including numbers and even tuples. We can mix different types of keys and different types of values in one dictionary. Keys are unique – if we repeat a key, we will overwrite the old value with the new value. When we store a value in a dictionary, the key doesn’t have to exist – it will be created automatically"
